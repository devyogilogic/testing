   <p> <h4>Description:</h4> 
	The true story of a <i><b><font color = "blue">prominent psychiatrist</font></b></i>, his young patient, and the past-life therapy that changed both their lives. As a traditional <i><b><font color = "blue">psychotherapist</font></b></i>, Dr. Brian Weiss was <i><b><font color = "blue">astonished</font></b></i> and<i><b><font color = "blue"> skeptical </font></b></i>when one of his patients began recalling past-life traumas that seemed to hold the key to her recurring nightmares and anxiety attacks. His <i><b><font color = "blue">skepticism </font></b></i>was eroded, however, when she began to channel messages from the space between lives, which contained remarkable revelations about Dr. Weiss' family and his dead son. Using past-life therapy, he was able to cure the patient and embark on a new, more meaningful phase of his own career.
